<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Anthony</h1>
<h3 align="center">A backend developer, boba addict, dog sibling</h3>

I'm an aspiring software engineer who has much to learn. I wish to make a difference in the world by making other people's lives easier through tech. I value great work ethics, honesty and quality products. I am proficient in Java and Python and briefly worked with C++ and Swift. Although I prefer the prior two languages I am open and willing to broaden my knowledge in others. I love learning new skills and try my best to always incorporate my newfound knowledge whether it's in developing new software or in life.

If I'm not infront of my computer coding, I am either deciding on the next boba shop to go to or finding my next favorite restaraunt. If you're in the Bay Area, don't be shy to contact me; if it's about food, boba or a company who shares the same values as me.

A little about me:
<p>✔️ Quick learner </p>
<p>✔️ Adaptable to challenges </p>
<p>✔️ Dependable </p>
<p>✔️ Team player </p>
